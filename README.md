A Ruby script to set up a React (and Rails API) app with customisations/packages/gems I mainly use.

### Run


```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:jaarnie/react-template-script.git
$ ruby react_template_script.rb
```

The program will ask you to name your project and then run Create React App while adding some extra files/folders and a new package.json before installing the packages. It'll then ask if you'd like to add a Rails API; again adding files/folders/gems before bundling.
